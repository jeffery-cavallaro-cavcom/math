\begin{theorem}[6.18]
  Let \(X\times Y\) be a product space with \(Y\) compact.  If \(U\in\T_{X\times Y}\) and
  \(\set{x_0}\times Y\subset U\) then there exists some \(W\in\T_X\) such that \(x_0\in W\) and
  \(W\times Y\subset U\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Assume \(U\in\T_{X\times Y}\) and \(\set{x_0}\times Y\subset U\).  Note that for each \(y\in Y\),
  \((x_0,y)\in\set{x_0}\times Y\subset U\).  Thus there exists sets \(U_y\in\T_X\) and \(V_y\in\T_Y\) such that
  \(\displaystyle\set{x_0}\times Y\subset\bigcup_{y\in Y}(U_y\times V_y)\subset U\), where the \(V_y\) are an open
  cover of \(Y\).  But \(Y\) is compact, so there exists some finite subcover \(\set{V_{y_1},\ldots,V_{y_n}}\) of
  \(Y\).  So select up to \(n\) open subsets of \(U_y\) and let \(\displaystyle W=\bigcap_{k=1}^nU_{y_k}\).  Note
  that \(W\in\T_X\) because it is a finite intersection of open sets.

  Claim: \(W\times Y\subset U\)

  Assume that \((x,y)\in W\times Y\).  This means that for some \(k\), \(x\in U_{y_k}\) and \(y\in V_{y_k}\).  And so
  \((x,y)\in U_{y_k}\times V_{y_k}\subset U\).
\end{proof}
