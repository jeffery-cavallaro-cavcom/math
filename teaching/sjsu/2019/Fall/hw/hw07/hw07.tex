\subsection*{Problem}

You are working quality control for a manufacturer of screws.  You are sampling a particular screw as it comes off
of the line.  You expect the length of the screw to follow a normal distribution as follows, where the mean and
standard deviation are expressed in centimeters (cm):
\[p(x)=\frac{1}{0.1\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-50(x-2)^2}\]
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the mean of the screw length?
\item What is the standard deviation of the screw length?
\item At what \(x\) value does the corresponding bell curve have its absolute maximum?
\item At what \(x\) values does the corresponding bell curve have its points of inflection?
\item What is the probability that a screw length will be between 1.8 and 2.2 cm?
\end{enumerate}
