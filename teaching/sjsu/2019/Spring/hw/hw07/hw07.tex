\begin{enumerate}
\item Sketch the graph \(y=-2\left(\frac{3}{2}-e^{3-x}\right)\) by:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Performing the necessary algebra so that the function is in the proper form (i.e., the transformations are in the
    proper order).
  \item Listing the transformations in the order that they are to be applied.
  \item Marking the key point and horizontal asymptote.
  \item Calculating and marking all existing intercepts.
  \item Sketching the final graph.
  \end{enumerate}

\item You open a new savings account on April 1 with an initial \$1000 at a local bank that pays 2\% interest, compounded
  monthly on the last day of the month.  You file the necessary direct deposit paperwork at you job, where you get paid
  monthly on the first of the month, so that \$500 will be auto-deposited into your new account each month, starting with
  your May paycheck.  In June, you withdraw \$250 to pay for a new mobile phone.  In July, you withdraw \$750 to help pay
  for your summer vacation.  There are no other transactions.  What is your account balance on August 2?
