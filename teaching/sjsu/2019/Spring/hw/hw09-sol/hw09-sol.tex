\subsection*{Problem}

Find the two first partial and four second partial derivatives for the following function of two variables.  Be sure to
perform all reasonable simplifications prior to taking derivatives.

  \scalebox{1.5}{\(\displaystyle f(x,y)=\ln\left[x^2e^{(x^3+1)y^2}\right]\)}
\end{quote}

First, let's simplify according to the log rules:
\begin{align*}
  f(x,y) &= \ln\left[x^2e^{(x^3+1)y^2}\right] \\
  &= \ln(x^2)+\ln(e^{(x^3+1)y^2}) \\
  f(x,y) &= 2\ln x+(x^3+1)y^2
\end{align*}
Now, find the two first partials:
\begin{gather*}
  f_x=\frac{2}{x}+3x^2y^2 \\
  \\
  f_y=2(x^3+1)y
\end{gather*}
Now, find the two unmixed second partials:
\begin{gather*}
  f_{xx}= -\frac{2}{x^2}+6xy^2 \\
  \\
  f_{yy}=2(x^3+1)
\end{gather*}
Finally, find the two mixed second partials:
\begin{gather*}
  f_{xy}= 6x^2y \\
  \\
  f_{yx}=6x^2y
\end{gather*}
Note that the two mixed second partials are the same, which is expected since all the partials are continuous.
