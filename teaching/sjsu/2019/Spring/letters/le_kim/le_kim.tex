\opening{To Whom It May Concern:}
It was my pleasure to have Ms.~Kim Le as my student for Math-71: Calculus for Business during the Spring 2019 semester at
SJSU.  Ms.~Le demonstrated her dedication to learning and her individual maturity by her excellent class attendance,
class participation, timely completion of her assignments, and admirable exam scores.  She was truly one of my most
outstanding students this past semester.

Studying abroad can be difficult, especially when learning in a second language.  Ms.~Le continually demonstrated to me that
she was well up to this challenge.  Her English was fluent and she was not shy about providing clear and concise answers
when I called upon her in class.  Indeed, I was sure that I would always get a correct answer from her when called upon.

I highly recommend that Ms.~Le continue her studies in the US.  I am confident that she will maintain the same level of
diligence concerning her class work that she demonstrated to me.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any other
questions regarding her academic work in mathematics.
\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
