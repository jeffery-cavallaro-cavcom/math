\subsection*{Problem}

A blu-ray disk has a diameter of $\SI{12}{cm}$.  The track of recorded information on the disk spirals in from the
outside toward the center.  A blu-ray player must make sure that the track passing under the optical reader stays
at a constant linear speed, so the motor will vary from $\SI{200}{}$ to $\SI{500}{rpm}$, depending on where the
disk is being read.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Which angular speed is used for the part of the track on the outer rim of the disk? Why?
\item What is the linear speed of the outer part of the track in cm/s?
\item What is the distance from the center of the disk to the innermost part of the track?
\end{enumerate}
