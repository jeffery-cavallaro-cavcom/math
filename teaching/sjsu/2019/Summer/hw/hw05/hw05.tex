\subsection*{Problems}

Consider the rational function:
\[y=\frac{2x^3-3x^2-3x+2}{2x^3+x^2-2x-1}\]

\begin{enumerate}
\item Completely factor the numerator and the denominator and rewrite the function in simplified, factored form.
\item Do the long division and rewrite the function in quotient/remainder form.
\item Where are the zeros?
\item Where are the poles?
\item Where are the holes?
\item Where are the horizontal asymptotes?
\item Where are the vertical asymptotes?
\item Where is the \(y\)-intercept?
\item What is the end-behavior as \(x\to\infty\)? (be sure to specify above or below)
\item What is the end-behavior as \(x\to-\infty\)? (be sure to specify above or below)
\item Sketch the graph.  All intercepts, asymptotes, and holes must be clearly marked.
\end{enumerate}
