Once again, greetings Math-8 students!

The class website is now up.  It is not very fancy, but it works.  You can find
it at:

http://www.cavcom.com/sjsu

The greensheet, reading assignments, homework assignments, and a sample final
can all be found there.  Please download and print the greensheet and bring it
with you to class - or you can view it from a tablet, PC, or phone during class.

The reading assignment for this week is 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4.  Please try and
read at least 0.1 and 0.2 before class on Monday (sorry for the short notice).
I will give you the first homework assignment on Monday.

Jeff
