Greetings Math 8 students!

My name is Jeffery Cavallaro and I am the TA instructor for sections 03 and 05.
You are receiving this email because you are currently enrolled in one of these
sections.  Note that since classes start on a Thursday this semester, we will
not meet until Monday of next week.

It is vital that you be in class on Monday.  If you are changing your schedule
and have decided not to take this class, or you are changing sections, then
please do so on mySJSU as soon as possible.  This class is impacted and there
will be students wanting to add, so please be a good citizen.

I should have the class webpage up and ready to go by Friday, so stay tuned for
another email in a couple of days.

Jeff
