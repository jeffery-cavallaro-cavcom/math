The homework solutions for week 1 are posted on the website.

For the quiz on Monday, make sure that you know the following:

- Set roster and set-builder (template and universe) notation.
- Set union, intersection, and difference operations.
- The definition of the N, W, Z, Q, R-Q, and R sets and which are subsets of
  which.
- Real number intervals in both inequality (e.g., x < 1) and interval
  (e.g., (-1,5]) notation and their corresponding diagrams.
- Unions, intersections, and differences of real number intervals.
- The relationship between absolute value and distance.
- Absolute value expressions.
- Difference and %-error word problems.

Good luck!

BTW: My boss Prof Hsu may be dropping by on Monday to observe (part of the
TA training here at SJSU).  He will also conduct an informal feedback
session sometime in the middle of the semester.
