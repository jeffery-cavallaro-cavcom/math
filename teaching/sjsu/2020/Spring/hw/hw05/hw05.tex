Section 1.6-1.8

\subsection*{Problem}

Prove the following theorem:

\begin{theorem}
  \(\forall\,n\in\Z,n\) is either even or odd (but not both).
\end{theorem}

Your proof must address the following points:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(n\) is even or odd (and nothing else).
\item \(n\) is odd \(\implies n\) is not even (hint: contradiction).
\item \(n\) is even \(\implies n\) is not odd (hint: contrapositive).
\end{enumerate}

The first point is a bit more difficult.  Start by making a statement about 0.  Then assuming that \(n\) is even,
what can you say about \(n-1\) and \(n+1\)?  Likewise, assuming that \(n\) is odd, what can you say about \(n-1\)
and \(n+1\).  Can you organize these facts into an argument that shows that you have accounted for all possible
\(n\in\Z\)?
