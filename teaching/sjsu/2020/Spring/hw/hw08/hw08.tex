\subsection*{Problems}

Consider \(f:A\to B\) and let \(S,T\subseteq A\).

\begin{enumerate}[left=0in]
\item Prove: \(f(S\cap T)\subseteq f(S)\cap f(T)\)
\item Draw a diagram that shows why this is a subset relationship and not set equality.  In other words, show why
  there can be elements in \(f(S)\cap f(T)\) that are not in \(f(S\cap T)\).
\item How can \(f\) be limited so that equality occurs.  In other words, how do you eliminate the problem in
  your drawing?
\item Which step in your proof is not reversible?
\end{enumerate}
