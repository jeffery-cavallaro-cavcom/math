\subsection*{Problem}

One of the most important definitions in mathematics (calculus in particular) is that of the limit of a sequence.
Consider the infinite sequence: \(1,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{4},\ldots\).  Such a sequence can be
represented as follows:
\[a_n=\frac{1}{n}, n\in\N\]
Note that the elements of the sequence get arbitrarily close to \(0\) as \(n\to\infty\).  We call such a point the
\emph{limit} of the sequence.

The formal definition for ``\(L\) is the limit of a sequence \(a_n\)'' is as follows:
\[\forall\,\e>0,\exists\,N\in\N,\forall\,n\in\N,n>N\implies\abs{a_n-L}<\e\]
Negate this proposition to obtain the definition of ``\(L\) is NOT the limit of a sequence \(a_n\).''
