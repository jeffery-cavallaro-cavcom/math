\subsection*{Problems}

How many possible 5-card poker hands from a standard deck are there with 3-of-a-kind (3 cards of the same rank and
2 additional cards).  You must NOT count 4-of-a-kind and full-house hands.  Thus the 2 additional cards cannot
match your 3-of-kind nor can they be a pair.  For full credit, you must explain each task in your procedure;
simply stating an answer receives no credit.
