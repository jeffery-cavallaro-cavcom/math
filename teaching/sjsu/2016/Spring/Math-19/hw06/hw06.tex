\section*{Reading}

Sections 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12

We will not cover 1.11 in class. You should study it to learn how to graph and
solve equations with your calculator.  Being able to do so allows you to check
you answers on problems that you do manually.  But, be warned: sketches and
solutions without supporting work will be assumed to have been copied from a
calculator and will receive no credit.
