\begin{enumerate}
\item Page 57 Problem 90. Make sure all of your stated solutions are in the
domain and are not extraneous!

\item Solve for $x$. Be sure to check for extraneous solutions.
\[x^2-\sqrt{9-3x^2}=0\]

\item A man stands atop a 100ft cliff and releases a ball so that it falls to
the ground.
\begin{enumerate}
\item How long does it take for the ball to hit the ground if he throws the
ball up with a velocity of $10 ft/s$?

\item In solving the problem, you probably came up with a positive and a
negative solution.  What does the negative solution represent?

\item Assume that a lady is standing on the ground below the cliff and throws
a ball up so that it passed the man on the cliff at a velocity of $10 ft/s$.
How long would it be before the ball hits the ground? (Hint: if you have
answered the first parts correctly then this part should take you 5 seconds
to answer!)
