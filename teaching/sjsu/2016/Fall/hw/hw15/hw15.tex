\underline{Reading}

\begin{itemize}
\item Text book section 5.1-5.3
\end{itemize}

\underline{Problems}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Consider the following system of equations:
  \[x^2+y^2-4x-6y-12=0\]
  \[x-y+6=0\]
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Determine the points of intersection (if any).
  \item Give a geometric description of the problem - what are the
    geometric figures involved, what are the possibilities of intersection
    (there are three), and which of those possibilities is represented by the
    problem.
  \end{enumerate}

\item Solve the following system of linear equations:
  \[3x+3y+5z=1\]
  \[3x+5y+9z=0\]
  \[5x+9y+17z=0\]
  You may use row operations directly on the equations, or use a matrix. For
  each step, clearly indicate the row operation used and state of the
  equations/matrix after the row operation.
\end{enumerate}
