\underline{Problems}

Make sure that all sketches have all important points and asymptotes
clearly marked.

\begin{enumerate}
\item List the transformations, find all intercepts, and sketch:
  \[y=-2e^{x+1}+5\]
  
\item List the transformations, find all intercepts, and sketch:
  \[y=3\ln(x-2)+1\]

\item Given:
  \[\log_b{2}=0.6931\]
  \[\log_b{3}=1.0986\]
  \[\log_b{5}=1.6094\]
  find $\log_b{\left(\frac{75}{4}\right)}$. You must use each one of the given
  values, you are not allowed to determine the value of $b$, and you must show
  exactly how you obtained the answer.

\item Consider the equation: $y=\log_a{x}$
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Derive the change of base formula for some arbitrary base $b$.
  \item Use your formula with $b=e$ and your calculator to compute
    $\log_7 100$.
  \item Assume that you made a mistake and used the common log key instead of
    the natural log key in the above calculation. Would you get a different
    answer? Why or why not?
  \end{enumerate}

\item Researchers tend to prefer exponential (base $e$) equations. For example,
  the normal equation for the radioactive decay of Carbon-14, which has a
  half-life of 5730 years, would be:
  \[A=A_0\cdot2^{-\frac{t}{5730}}\]
  But the preferred exponential equations is:
  \[A=A_oe^{-\frac{t}{a}}\]
  Solve for $a$, rounding to the nearest integer value.
\end{enumerate}
