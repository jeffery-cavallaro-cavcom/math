\underline{Problems}

\begin{enumerate}
\item You are a cost accountant at a firm that manufactures pencils. You
  prepare next month's cost study for your boss as follows:

  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
    \hline
    item & cost (\$) \\
    \hline
    wood (per pencil) & 0.05 \\
    graphite (per pencil) & 0.02 \\
    paint (per pencil) & 0.01 \\
    rubber (per pencil) & 0.04 \\
    metal (per pencil) & 0.03 \\
    lease on plant & 10,000 \\
    labor & 20,000 \\
    depreciation & 10,000 \\
    utilities & 5,000 \\
    other plant costs & 7,500 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}

  Your marketing department's research indicates that you can sell your pencils
  to retailers at $25$ cents per pencil.
