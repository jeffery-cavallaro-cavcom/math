\underline{Problems}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Consider the function:
  \[f(x)=2\tan(4\pi x-\pi)+1\]
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item What is the period $P$?
  \item What is the horizontal translation $b$?
  \item What is the phase angle $\phi$?
  \item What is the y-intercept?
  \item Sketch one cycle of the graph in the interval $(b,b+P)$ and then extend
    the sketch back to the y-intercept.
  \end{enumerate}

\item Two $\SI{1}{kg}$ masses are each suspended on a spring with $k=\pi^2$ and
  are stretched downward by 2 units. The first spring is released at $t=0$. The
  second spring is released at $t=3$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Find $f_1(t)$ for the first mass.
  \item Find $f_2(t)$ for the second mass.
  \item What is the phase difference between the two masses?
  \end{enumerate}

\item Evaluate:
  \[\cot\left(\cos^{-1}\frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\right)\]

\item A water tower is located $\SI{500}{ft}$ from a building. An observer
  looks at the tower from a window in the building. The angle of depression
  to the bottom of the tower is $45^{\circ}$. The angle of elevation to the
  top of the tower is $15^{\circ}$. How tall is the tower (to the nearest foot)?
\end{enumerate}
