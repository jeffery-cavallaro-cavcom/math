\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine the domain for the following function:
  \[f(x)=\sqrt{-\frac{(x+5)(4-x)^2}{x(1-x)(x-2)^2}}\]
  Express the domain in interval notation.

\item Solve the following inequality, expressing the answer in interval
  notation:
  \[x^2+4x\ge 21\]
  Now state the answer (don't do any additional work) for the following in
  interval notation:
  \[x^2+4x-21<0\]

\item Solve for $x$ (Hint: what kind of equation does this look like?):
  \[(x+1)^2+3\abs{x+1}-4=0\]

\item Smallville, USA has designed their downtown so that their city hall,
  fire station, and police station all occur on a line. If the fire station
  is at the point 0 on the line and the police station is at the point 3 on
  the line, and city hall is twice as far from the fire station as the police
  station, then can you tell exactly where city hall is on the line? You must
  explain exactly how you determine this.
