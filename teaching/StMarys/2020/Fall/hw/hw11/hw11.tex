Consider the function:
\[f(x)=x^3-4x^2-4x+16\]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Using the rational roots theorem, completely factor \(f(x)\).
\item What are the critical points of \(f(x)\)?
\item What is the \(y\)-intercept of \(f(x)\)?
\item What are the critical points of \(f'(x)\)?
\item Using the first derivative test, determine the relative extrema of \(f(x)\).
\item Using the second derivative test, verify the relative extrema of \(f(x)\).
\item What are the critical points of \(f''(x)\)?
\item Using the second derivative, prove that the critical point of \(f''(x)\) is a point of inflection.
\item What is the end behavior of \(f(x)\)?
\item Sketch \(f(x)\).  For full credit, all intercepts, extrema, and points of inflection must be labeled with
  their coordinate values.
\end{enumerate}
