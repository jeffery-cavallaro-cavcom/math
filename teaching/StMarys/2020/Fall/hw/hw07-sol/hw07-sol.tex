A ball is thrown upward off of a \SI{100}{ft} cliff at a velocity of \SI{64}{ft/s}.  The equation of motion for the
ball is:
\[h(t)=100+64t-16t^2\]
\begin{enumerate}[left=0in]
\item\label{part-a} Using the derivative formulas, determine \(h'(t)\).
  \[h'(t)=0+64(1)-2(16)t^{2-1}=64-32t\]
\item Using your answer to part (\ref{part-a}) (and not the vertex formula \(-\frac{b}{2a}\)), at what time does the
  ball reach its maximum height (hint: how fast is the ball going at that point)?

  When the ball reaches its maximum height, gravity has stopped it so the velocity at the maximum height is 0:
  \begin{gather*}
    64-32t=0 \\
    32t=64 \\
    t=2
  \end{gather*}
  Therefore, the ball reaches its maximum height after \SI{2}{s}.

\item What is the balls maximum height?
  \[h(2)=100+64(2)-16(2)^2=100+128-64=164\]
  Therefore, the ball reaches a maximum height of \SI{164}{ft}

\item\label{part-d} How long before the ball hits the ground?

  When the ball hits the ground, \(h(t)=0\):
  \begin{gather*}
    100+64t-16t^2=0 \\
    4t^2-16t-25=0 \\
    t=\frac{16\pm\sqrt{(-16)^2-4(4)(-25)}}{2(4)} \\
    t=\frac{16\pm\sqrt{256+400}}{8} \\
    t=\frac{16\pm\sqrt{656}}{8} \\
    t=\frac{16\pm4\sqrt{41}}{8} \\
    t=\frac{4\pm\sqrt{41}}{2} \\
    t\approx-1.2,5.2
  \end{gather*}
  Therefore, the ball hits the ground after \SI{5.2}{s}.
  
\item Note that you probably got two solutions (one positive and one negative) for the part (\ref{part-d}), and you
  should have selected the positive one.  What is the meaning of the negative solution (hint: what is the meaning
  of negative time)?

  The negative solution corresponds to the ball being thrown up from the ground \SI{1.2}{s} earlier with sufficient
  velocity such that it is going \SI{64}{ft/s} as it passes the top of the cliff.  Note that the ball will follow the
  same path once it passes that top of the cliff.  The required initial velocity will be the same as the velocity when
  the ball hits the ground:
  \[v(5.2)=64-32(5.2)=-102.4\]
  So the ball must be thrown upward from the ground at a velocity of \SI{102.4}{ft/s} so that it follows the same
  path as a ball thrown upward from the cliff at \SI{64}{ft/s}.
\end{enumerate}
