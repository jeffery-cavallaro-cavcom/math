A ball is thrown upward off of a \SI{100}{ft} cliff at a velocity of \SI{64}{ft/s}.  The equation of motion for the
ball is:
\[h(t)=100+64t-16t^2\]
\begin{enumerate}[left=0in]
\item Using the \emph{definition of the derivative} (i.e., not the derivative formulas), determine \(h'(t)\).
\item How fast is the ball traveling and in which direction (up or down) after \SI{5}{sec}?
\item What is the ball's height after \SI{5}{sec}?
\item What is the equation of the tangent line to the curve at \(t=5\)?
\item What is the equation of the normal line to the curve at \(t=5\)?
\end{enumerate}
