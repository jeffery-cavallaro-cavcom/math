A ball is thrown upward off of a \SI{100}{ft} cliff at a velocity of \SI{64}{ft/s}.  The equation of motion for the
ball is:
\[h(t)=100+64t-16t^2\]
\begin{enumerate}[left=0in]
\item\label{part-a} Using the derivative formulas, determine \(h'(t)\).
\item Using your answer to part (\ref{part-a}) (and not the vertex formula \(-\frac{b}{2a}\)), at what time does the
  ball reach its maximum height (hint: how fast is the ball going at that point)?
\item What is the balls maximum height?
\item\label{part-d} How long before the ball hits the ground?
\item Note that you probably got two solutions (one positive and one negative) for the part (\ref{part-d}), and you
  should have selected the positive one.  What is the meaning of the negative solution (hint: what is the meaning
  of negative time)?
\end{enumerate}
